              <details>
                <summary>Can I be required to stay on the premises during my meal break?</summary>
                <p>
                  Generally no. You should be free to leave the workplace during your meal break. 
                  If you must stay on premises due to the nature of your work, it may be an "on-duty" 
                  meal period that must be paid and agreed to in writing.
                </p>
              </details>
              
              <details>
                <summary>What if I choose to work through my meal break?</summary>
                <p>
                  Even if you choose to work through your meal break, your employer still owes you 
                  the meal period premium if they didn't provide the opportunity for an uninterrupted 
                  30-minute break.
                </p>
              </details>
              
              <details>
                <summary>Can my employer automatically deduct meal breaks from my pay?</summary>
                <p>
                  Only if you actually take the full, uninterrupted meal break. If your break is 
                  missed or interrupted, the automatic deduction becomes an illegal wage deduction 
                  and you're owed both the wages and the penalty.
                </p>

            <h2>Take Action on Meal Break Violations</h2>
            <p>
              Meal break violations are common but recoverable. Don't let employers steal your 
              break time without compensation. California law provides strong protections and 
              penalties to ensure you get the breaks you're entitled to.
