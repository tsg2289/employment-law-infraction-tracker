              <p>
                Too many employees suffer workplace violations in silence, either unaware of their rights 
                or unsure how to document and address illegal conduct. The Employment Law Infraction Tracker 
                was created to bridge this gap by providing:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Education:</strong> Clear, accessible information about employment laws</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Secure tools to track violations and build evidence</li>
                <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Resources to understand legal options and take action</li>

                <h2>About Thomas St. Germain, Esq.</h2>
                <p>
                  Thomas St. Germain is a licensed attorney specializing in employment law with a focus 
                  on protecting employee rights. With extensive experience in California employment law, 
                  he has witnessed firsthand how workplace violations can devastate employees' lives 
                  and careers.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Why This Tracker Was Created</h3>
                <p>
                  Throughout his practice, Attorney St. Germain noticed a recurring problem: employees 
                  would come to him months or years after violations occurred, often with insufficient 
                  documentation to build a strong case. Many had suffered in silence, unaware that 
                  their employer's conduct was illegal.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  This tracker was born from the recognition that employees need resources <em>before</em> 
                  they seek legal help - tools to recognize violations as they happen, document them 
                  properly, and understand their rights in real-time.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Legal Philosophy</h3>
                <blockquote>
                  "Every employee deserves to work with dignity, free from discrimination, harassment, 
                  and wage theft. Knowledge is power, and informed employees are empowered employees. 
                  This tracker ensures no violation goes unnoticed or undocumented."
                </blockquote>
